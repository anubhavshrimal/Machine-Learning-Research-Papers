Summary: Visualize CNN Filters / Kernels using De-Convolutions on CNN filter activations.

# Questions

### What did authors try to accomplish?

- Visualize CNN Filters / Kernels.
- Trying to get better CNN architecture by understanding the filter activation visualizations.

### What were the key elements of the approach?

- Use De-Convolutional Neural Networks (DeConvnets) in each layer of CNN after setting all activations to zero other than the one to be visualized.
- Understanding what are the key regions that different CNN Kernels look at after training.
- Understanding the effects of obscuring different regions of image.

### What can you use yourself from this paper?

- How to visualize the filters of a trained CNN model.
- How to understand what a trained model is looking at to make predictions.

### What other references to follow?

- N/A
