Summary: The paper introduces a scalable method called "instruction backtranslation" to create a high-quality instruction-following language model. This method involves self-augmentation and self-curation of training examples generated from web documents, resulting in a model that outperforms others in its category without relying on distillation data, showcasing its effective self-alignment capability.
