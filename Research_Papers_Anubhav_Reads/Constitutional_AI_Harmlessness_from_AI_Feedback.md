Summary: The paper introduces Constitutional AI, a method for training a safe AI assistant without human-labeled data on harmful outputs. It combines supervised learning and reinforcement learning phases, enabling the AI to engage with harmful queries by explaining its objections, thus improving control, transparency, and human-judged performance with minimal human oversight.
